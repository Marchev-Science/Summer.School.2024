## Delivery of the case solutions:

1. Before the deadline (13:00,30.06.2024) you should deliver the solutions [here...](https://forms.gle/3Gkw4rAErSFa4tFh8)
2. The solution should consist of several files (4-5 max) without subfolders, at least the following:  
* Code / workflow files which could be run on some of the required software for the summer school.  
* In the code or in additional files there should be: sufficient documentation of the code, complete explanations / visualisations and data anaysis results to solve the case.  
* List of authors.  
* a text file explaining delivered filenames with a sentance of description  
3. Code requrements  
* Submit in the correct, working file format (e.g., .R instead of .txt or .py instead of .txt)  
* The software should be self-contained - installation of all necessary libraries should be included, and if possible: define the entire working environment (environment)  
* List of library and version requirements  
* Independence from the operating system  
* Acceptable clear formatting  
* the delivered filenames should strictly follow these requirements: no cyrillic or other exotic languages or symbols, no intervals, no capital letters  
* You should not deliver anything which is not rendered or produced by your code - the code can produce it on its own. If you want to specifically showcase some data/chart/other, put them in the documentation file and describe it  
4. There could be more than one solution per team.  
5. Each team will be given about 15-20 minutes to present their solutions followed by Q&A session.
